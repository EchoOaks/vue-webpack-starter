# vue webpack 4 lean starter
I wanted a Vue.js lightweight starter template, with newer versions of less tools than the ones used in the official vue-cli, so I created my own one from scratch.

This template uses webpack 4 and the webpack-dev-server with hot reload enabled.
It is a ready to use template, to start developing single page applications with Vue.js single file components.

## Features
- Vue.js
- Vuex
- Vue-router
- Axios
- Promise polyfill
- Webpack 4
- Webpack-dev-server with hot reload
- Babel 7
- Vue-loader
- ESLint
- Autoprefixer
- Scss-loader
- CSS extraction to a file
- Gulp 4 for compiling scss
- Css original reset, that merges Meyer's reset with normalize.css
