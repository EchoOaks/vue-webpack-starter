# vue-webpack4-serve
I needed a Vue.js lightweight starter template for my projects, with newer technologies than the ones used in the official vue cli, so I created my own one from scratch.

This template uses webpack 4 and the modern development server [webpack-serve](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-serve) with webpack-hot-client enabled.

## Main characteristics
It is a ready to use template, to start developing single page applications with Vue.js single file components.
- vue.js
- vuex
- vue-router
- promise auto polyfill
- axios
- webpack 4
- webpack-serve instead of the older webpack-dev-server
- babel
- autoprefixer
- scss-loader
- gulp 4 for compiling scss
- css original reset, that merges Meyer reset with normalize
