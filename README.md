# Vue webpack 4 lean starter
I wanted a Vue.js lightweight starter template, with newer versions of less tools than the ones used in the official vue-cli, so I created my own one from scratch.

This template it is a ready to use, to start developing single page applications with Vue.js single file components. It uses Webpack 4, webpack-dev-server with hot reload enabled.

The basic environment configuration is imported from the module `.env`, through merging properties of the objects defined in the files inside `.env` directory, with node environment ones.
- If `NODE_ENV` is undefined or equal to `"production"` then `.env-production.js` is used in merging and `NODE_ENV` is set to `"production"`
- If `NODE_ENV` is equal to `"development"` then `.env-production.js` is used in merging and `NODE_ENV` is set to  `"development"`

It is possible to add configuration by simply defining new properties on the configuration objects exported by the `.env` modules.

**Important:** remember to **uncomment out** `# .env/` line (â†’ `.env/`) in `.gitignore` file before the first commit, if you don't want to publish in the repository, possible secrets contained inside the environment files.

Gulp is configurated to compile scss files and serve the page.

It's possible to code in parallel the page HTML and SCSS external to Vue files, using Gulp with Browsersync or Gulp and webpack-dev-server in watch mode. Use only one of the following options:
- Execute command `gulp` . In this case Gulp watches SCSS files compiling them when they change, and also starts Browsersync, which injects compiled CSS without reloading and reloads page HTML if changed
- Execute command `npm run serve:watch` and `gulp watch` . In this case Gulp watches SCSS files compiling them when they change, and webpack-dev-server watches for changes of files in the src directory, automatically recompiling Vue files and reloading the app and HTML page
